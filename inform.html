				Menstruation is a normal part of female life, but did you know that some menstruation products are actually causing significant harm to our planet? Approximately 12 billion pads and 9 billion tampons are thrown out each year in the US, meaning close to 20 billion menstruation product waste ends up in our landfills each year. Since these products are mostly plastic, they will take centuries to break down. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Additionally, menstruation products like pads and tampons are made from harmful materials, like rayon and low-density polyethylene. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Most pads and tampons are made from a material called rayon, which is made from wood-pulp that is sourced from softwood trees. Although this material is plant-based, it does not mean it is sustainable, as it contributes to deforestation. The chemicals used to process rayon are so toxic that it can lead to a higher risk of heart disease, nerve damage, and strokes in the factory workers that create this material.  
				<br>
				<br>
				The plastic used in pads and tampon applicators are made from LDPE, or low-density polyethylene. To create this plastic material, energy-intensive processes are required and it is non-biodegradable. Natural gas, mainly containing methane, is a key ingredient in creating polyethylene. Natural gas released in the air lowers the air quality and contributes to greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere, leading to climate change.
				<br>
				<br>
				We canâ€™t change this natural function of our body, but we can make more eco-conscious choices when it comes to menstruation products.
